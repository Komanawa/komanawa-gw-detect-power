   The DetectionPowerSlope class is used to calculate the power of a change detection test based on observing
   a slope in the concentration data. The user passes a True concentration time series and the power is calculated
   by adding many noise realisations to the concentration data and then running one of multiple change detection tests on the noisy
   data.

   The Power is calculated as the percentage (0-100) of simulations which detect a slope.

   :param significance_mode: significance mode to use, options:

            * linear-regression: linear regression of the concentration data from time 0 to the end change detected if p < min_p_value
            * linear-regression-from-[max|min]: linear regression of the concentration data from the maximum concentration of the noise free concentration data to the end change detected if p < min_p_value
            * mann-kendall: mann-kendall test of the concentration data from time 0 to the end, change detected if p < min_p_value
            * mann-kendall-from-[max|min]: mann-kendall test of the concentration data from the maximum/minimum of the noise free concentration data to the end, change detected if p < min_p_value
            * n-section-mann-kendall: 2+ part mann-kendall test to identify change points. if change points are detected then a change is detected
            * pettitt-test: pettitt test to identify change points. if change points are detected then a change is detected

   :param nsims: number of noise simulations to run for each change detection (e.g. nsims=1000, power= number of detected changes/1000 noise simulations)
   :param min_p_value: minimum p value to consider a change detected
   :param min_samples: minimum number of samples required, less than this number of samples will raise an exception
   :param expect_slope: expected slope of the concentration data, use depends on significance mode:

                         * linear-regression, linear-regression-from-max, mann-kendall, or mann-kendall-from-max:
                           * one of 1 (increasing), -1 (decreasing), or 'auto' will match the slope of the concentration data before noise is added

                         * n-section-mann-kendall: expected trend in each part of the time series (1 increasing, -1 decreasing, 0 no trend)
                         * pettitt-test: not used.

   :param efficent_mode: bool, default = True, if True then

                        * For linear regression and MannKendall based tests:  run the test on the noise free data to see if any change can be detected, if no change is detected then the test will not be on the noisy data
                        * For MultiPartMannKendall test: the test will be run on the noise free data to detect best change points and then the test will be run on the noisy data for a smaller window centered on the True change point see: * mpmk_efficent_min, * mpmk_window
                        * For Pettitt Test:  Not implemented, will be ignored and a waring passed

   :param nparts: number of parts to use for the n-section-mann-kendall test (not used for other tests)
   :param min_part_size: minimum number of samples in each part for the n-section-mann-kendall test (not used for other tests)
   :param no_trend_alpha: alpha value to use for the no trend sections in the n-section-mann-kendall test trendless sections are only accepted if p > no_trend_alpha (not used for other tests)
   :param mpmk_check_step: int or function, default = 1, number of samples to check for a change point in the MultiPartMannKendall test, used in both efficent_mode=True and efficent_mode=False if mpmk is a function it must take a single argument (n, number of samples) and return an integer check step
   :param mpmk_efficent_min: int, default = 10, minimum number of possible change points to assess only used if efficent_mode = True  The minimum number of breakpoints to test (mpmk_efficent_min) is always respected (i.e. if the window size is less than the minimum number of breakpoints to test, then the window size will be increased to the minimum number of breakpoints to test, but the space between breakpoints will still be defined by check_step). You can specify the exact number of breakpoints to check by setting mpmk_efficent_min=n breakpoints and setting mpmk_window=0
   :param mpmk_window: float, default = 0.05, define the window around the true detected change point to run the MultiPartMannKendall.  The detction window is defined as: (cp - mpmk_window*n, cp + mpmk_window*n) where cp is the detected change `point and n is the number of samples in the time series Whe`re both a mpmk_window and a check_step>1 is passed the mpmk_window will be used to de`fine the window size and the check_step` will be used to define the step size within the window.`
   :param nsims_pettit: number of simulations to run for calc`ulating the pvalue of the pettitt test (not used for other tests)
   :param ncores: number of cores to use for multiprocessing, None will use all available cores
   :param log_level: logging level for multiprocessing subprocesses
   :param return_true_conc: return the true concentration time series for each simulation with power calcs (not supported with multiprocessing power calcs)
   :param return_noisy_conc_itters: int <= nsims, default = 0 Number of noisy simulations to return. if 0 then no noisy simulations are returned, not supported with multiprocessing power calcs
   :param only_significant_noisy: bool if True then only return noisy simulations where a change was detected if there are fewer noisy simulations with changes detected than return_noisy_conc_itters all significant simulations will be returned. if there are no noisy simulations with changes detected then and empty dataframe is returned
   :param print_freq: None or int:  if None then no progress will be printed, if int then progress will be printed every print_freq simulations (n%print_freq==0)
   :param raise_from_minmax_nsamples: bool, if True then raise an exception if the maximum concentration is too far along the time series to be detected, if False then return 0 power and no change detected

      All values from here on out should be either a single value or an array of values with the same shape as id_vals

      :param error_vals: standard deviation of noise to add for each simulation
      :param true_conc_ts_vals: the true concentration time series for each simulation, note that this can be a list of arrays of different lengths for each simulation, as Numpy does not support jagged arrays
      :param seed: ndarray (integer seeds), None (no seeds), or int (1 seed for all simulations)
      :param run: if True run the simulations, if False just build  the run_dict and print the number of simulations

      calculate the slope detection power of a given concentration time series, note the power is calculated using the sampling frequency of the true_conc_ts, if you want to test the power at a different sampling frequency then you should resample the true_conc_ts before passing it to this function

      :param idv: identifiers for the power calc sites, passed straight through to the output
      :param error: standard deviation of the noise
      :param true_conc_ts: the true concentration timeseries for the power calc

      Possible other dataframes if self.return_true_conc is True or self.return_noisy_conc_itters > 0 in which case a dictionary will be returned:

      {'power': power_df, # always
      'true_conc': true_conc_ts, if self.return_true_conc is True
      'noisy_conc' : noisy_conc_ts, if self.return_noisy_conc_itters > 0
