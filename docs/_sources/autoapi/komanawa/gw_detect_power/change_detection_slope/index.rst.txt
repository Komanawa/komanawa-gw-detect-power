   This class is used to calculate the slope detection power of an auto created concentration
   time series. The user specifies an initial concentration, a target concentration. Other parameters
   include groundwater age distribution models and parameters, implementation time and the slope of
   the previous data. The user then specifies the sampling duration, and frequency.
   The power is calculated by adding many noise realisations to the concentration data and then running one of
   multiple change detection tests on the noisy data.

   The Power is calculated as the percentage (0-100) of simulations which detect a slope.

   :param significance_mode: significance mode to use, options:

            * linear-regression: linear regression of the concentration data from time 0 to the end change detected if p < min_p_value
            * linear-regression-from-[max|min]: linear regression of the concentration data from the maximum concentration of the noise free concentration data to the end change detected if p < min_p_value
            * mann-kendall: mann-kendall test of the concentration data from time 0 to the end, change detected if p < min_p_value
            * mann-kendall-from-[max|min]: mann-kendall test of the concentration data from the maximum/minimum of the noisefree concentration data to the end, change detected if p < min_p_value
            * n-section-mann-kendall: 2+ part mann-kendall test to identify change points. if change points are detected then a change is detected
            * pettitt-test: pettitt test to identify change points. if change points are detected then a change is detected

   :param nsims: number of noise simulations to run for each change detection (e.g. nsims=1000, power= number of detected changes/1000 noise simulations)
   :param min_p_value: minimum p value to consider a change detected
   :param min_samples: minimum number of samples required, less than this number of samples will raise an exception
   :param expect_slope: expected slope of the concentration data, use depends on significance mode:

                         * linear-regression, linear-regression-from-max, mann-kendall, mann-kendall-from-max: one of 1 (increasing), -1 (decreasing), or 'auto' will match the slope of the concentration data before noise is added
                         * n-section-mann-kendall: expected trend in each part of the time series (1 increasing, -1 decreasing, 0 no trend)

                        * For MultiPartMannKendall test: the test will be run on the noise free data to detect best change points and then the test will be run on the noisy data for a smaller window centered on the True change point see: "mpmk_efficent_min" and "mpmk_window"
                        * For Pettitt Test:  Not implemented, will be ignored and a waring passed

You can specify the exact number of breakpoints to check by setting mpmk_efficent_min=n breakpoints and setting mpmk_window=0
   :param mpmk_window: float, default = 0.05, define the window around the true detected change point to run the MultiPartMannKendall.  The detction window is defined as: (cp - mpmk_window*n, cp + mpmk_window*n) where cp is the detected change point and n is the number of samples in the time series Where both a mpmk_window and a check_step>1 is passed the mpmk_window will be used to define the window size and the check_step will be used to define the step size within the window.

      :param seed: ndarray (integer seeds), None (no seeds), or int (1 seed for all simulations)
      :param run: if True run the simulations, if False just build  the run_dict and print the number of simulations
      :param debug_mode: if True run as single process to allow for easier debugging
      :param kwargs: any other kwargs to pass directly to the output dataframe
      :return: dataframe with input data and the results of all of the power calcs. note power is percent 0-100



   .. py:method:: plot_iteration(y0, true_conc, ax=None)

      plot the concentration data itteration and the true concentration data if provided as well as the power test results and any predictions from the power test (e.g. the slope of the line used)

      :param y0: noisy concentration data
      :param true_conc: true concentration data
      :return: fig, ax



   .. py:method:: power_calc(idv, error: float, true_conc_ts: numpy.ndarray, seed: {int, None} = None, testnitter=None, **kwargs)

      calculate the slope detection power of a given concentration time series, note the power is calculated using the sampling frequency of the true_conc_ts, if you want to test the power at a different sampling frequency then you should resample the true_conc_ts before passing it to this function

      :param idv: identifiers for the power calc sites, passed straight through to the output
      :param error: standard deviation of the noise
      :param true_conc_ts: the true concentration timeseries for the power calc
      :param seed: int or None for random seed
      :param testnitter: None (usually) or a different nitter then self.niter for testing run times
      :param kwargs: any other kwargs to pass directly to the output Series
      :return: pd.Series with the power calc results note power is percent 0-100

      Possible other dataframes if self.return_true_conc is True or self.return_noisy_conc_itters > 0 in which case a dictionary will be returned:

      {'power': power_df, # always
      'true_conc': true_conc_ts, if self.return_true_conc is True
      'noisy_conc' : noisy_conc_ts, if self.return_noisy_conc_itters > 0
      }
